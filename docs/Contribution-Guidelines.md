# How to contribute to the Tilli Project?
 
  The best way to contribute to this project is by making a pull request in following ways

-   Fork the Tilli project and work on your fork
-   Create a new branch on which you want to make changes - “git checkout -b ‘my-contribution’ ” or push your changes on develop branch
-   Please make one pull request per issue to avoid large merges.
-   Commit your change with a commit message describing the correction.
-   Submit a pull request against the Tilli repository.
    In general, all pull requests must:
-   Have a clear use case, fix a demonstrable bug or serve the greater good of the project
-   Have unit tests, where appropriate;
-   Follow code style guidelines
-   Not break the existing test suite
-   Where bugs are fixed, where possible, there should be unit tests demonstrating the bug and also proving the fix. This helps prevent regression.
-   Change relevant comments and documentation when the behavior of code changes.
