- It is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations; or
- It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.

# How We Protect Your Information- Security and Password
Tilli takes what it believes to be commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information. However, since no security system is impenetrable and “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information or Browsing Information. If you create an account, you may be asked to choose a password for your account, which can be used to access information associated with your account (including Personal Information). You should choose a password that is not easy to guess, and does not use words that you would find in a dictionary. Do not disclose your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and we will attribute activities that occur using your account information (e.g., through the use of your password) to you. If you suspect that your password has been compromised, contact us immediately at support@tillikids.org.


# Email and Recomendation Communication:
We may send you, or you may elect to sign up to receive, emails from us. To help us understand whether we are providing information of interest to you, we may include software code or other tracking technologies in our emails to monitor whether you opened a particular email, whether you have clicked on the images and/or links in the email, the date and time the message was opened, and whether your computer is capable of receiving HTML-based email.
We endeavor to allow you to unsubscribe at any time from our email programs by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email message. We reserve the right to send you service announcements or similar administrative messages within an app. If you wish to opt out or withdraw consent, please refer to Processing Personal Data to know how.

Additionally, if you have queries regarding the same, feel free to contact us at 
 support@tillikids.org.


# Compromise of Personal Information:
In the event that Personal Information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Tilli will promptly notify those persons whose Personal Information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law. In the event that we or our service suffers a data security breach that requires us to provide you with notice, such as under applicable law, you consent to allow us to provide you with such notice by sending an e-mail to the primary e-mail address that is associated with your account.




# Childrens Privacy Policy:
We respect children’s privacy, and it is our greatest priority to protect any such limited data. The Children’s Privacy Policy explains our data collection, use, and protection processes. All references to “children” or “child” in this Children’s Privacy Policy shall mean children under 16 years of age, and all references to the term “parent” shall include legal guardians.
The most important point to note is that the Tilli website is not intended for children. Children need not access it. We don’t market to them and never knowingly collect any personal information from children.
All the learning and play experience that add up to the “Tilli experience” for children is limited to the Tillis app. App is tailor-made to limit the use of children’s information and protect their privacy. Our apps contain no external links to third-party websites or services.
Parents and educators can download the app from Google PlayStore. We encourage parents and educators to complete the simple onboarding process to help children get started. Downloading the app doesn’t trigger the collection of any Personally Identifiable Information. 
We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA")to the best of our knowledge, and we only collect analytics data (does not include Personally Identifiable Information) from the App. This data is anonymized and used as an aggregate to solely improve the play and learning experience of the Tilli app. This data is not used for any commercial purposes.
If the service is being used by a school and/or teacher (the “Educational Institution”) with students under 16 years of age, such Educational Institution agrees that it has reviewed our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. The app only request Personally Identifiable Information from parents and/or teachers. We will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, Personally Identifiable Information from users known to be under 16 years of age. We collect only the minimum amount of information needed about students from teachers. 
If a parent or an educator discovers any information shared/collected without your approval, please email us at support@tillikids.org. We will do what is needed to delete such information from our systems.

## Governing Law- Visitors Residing Outside the United States:
This Privacy Policy and the privacy practices of our service are governed solely under the laws of United states without regard to its conflict of law principles. Those who use our service and reside outside the United States are responsible for compliance with local laws. If you reside outside of the United States, by using our service, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, processing and use of your personal information in the United States of America in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Update to our Privacy Policy:
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any updates. If you continue to use the service following the posting of an updated version of this Privacy Policy, we will treat your continued use as acceptance of the updated version.
If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you more prominently. If we affect the way we handle Personal Information collected from children users (if applicable), we will first notify and obtain verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.
